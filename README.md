# Sentiment-Analysis-of-COVID-19-Vaccination-Tweets

The main objective of this project was to analyze public sentiment towards COVID-19 vaccinations using Twitter data. I aimed to classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments and gain insights into public opinion on this critical health topic.
I used natural language processing techniques to preprocess the text data, executed comprehensive data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis for a dataset of 11,020 COVID-19 vaccination tweets, enhancing visualization capabilities that led to clearer insights and faster decision-making processes. Planned TextBlob for initial sentiment classification and created word clouds to visualize frequent terms and compared machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree) for sentiment prediction. Achieved up to 90.52% accuracy after hyperparameter tuning, providing valuable insights for public health decision-making
Tools: utilized several Python libraries and technologies, including:
1.	Pandas for data manipulation
2.	NLTK for natural language processing tasks
3.	Scikit-learn for machine learning models and evaluation
4.	Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
5.	TextBlob for sentiment polarity calculation
6.	WordCloud for generating word clouds
7.	NumPy for numerical operations
